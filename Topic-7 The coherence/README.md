## Discussion

1. Define the frequency resolution.  How do you “improve” it?  (What does that mean?)

2. Define the Nyquist frequency.  How do you “improve” it?  (What does that mean?)

3. Define the coherence in words.

4. What are the units of coherence?

5. What is the role of phase in the coherence?

6. How is coherence related to the power spectrum?

7. Given two example signals, what do you expect for the coherence?
