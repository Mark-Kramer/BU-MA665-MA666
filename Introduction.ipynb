    "To be frank:  this notebook is rather boring.  In this class, we will use the software package <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\" rel=\"external\">Python</a>. The best way to learn new software (and probably most things) is when motivated by a particular problem.  Would you read assembly instructions for furniture you do not plan to own?  Probably not. In other notebooks we will pursue specific questions driven by neuronal data, and use our desire to understand these data to motivate the development and application of computational methods.  But not in this notebook.  Here, we focus on basic coding techniques and principles in Python in the abstract, without motivation.  You - poor learner - must trust that these ideas and techniques will eventually be useful.  We begin by dipping our toe into the Python pool, and learning the basic strokes;  the fun and interesting parts in the \"real world\" of neuronal data happen later."
